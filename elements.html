									<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
									<p>Bellabeat founded in 2013, is a high-tech company that produces health focused smart products. 
										It has empowered women with knowledge about their health and habits by the collections of data on activity, sleep, stress and reproductive health. 
										Bellabeats founder Urška Sršen believes that an analysis of its current data would reveal more opportunities for growth. Which will lead to recommendations for improving Bellabeats marketing strategies. </p>
									
									<header>
										<h3>ASK: </h3>
										
									</header>
									<p>Business problem: How can we analyze Fitbit data to grow Bellabeat into a top leading company in the smart device industry? 

 

										<p>Business Task: Analyze and gain insight from Fitbit data (non bellabeat device) to promote Bellabeat into a top leading company in the fitness industry </p>
										
										 
										
										<p>Key Stakeholders:</p>						 
										
										<p>Urška Sršen: Co-founder and CCO</p>						 
										
										<p>Sando Mur: Co-founder and executive team member</p>

										<h3>PREPARE: </h3>
										</header>

											<p>The data used for this analysis is from FitBit Fitness Tracker found on Kaggle. This dataset is CC0 a Public Domain made available through Mobius. It consists of data containing personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users. The eligible Fitbit users agreed to submitting their personal tracker data. The dataset used is CC0: Public Domain, everyone has access and the ability to copy, distribute and modify for any purpose.The data is traceable because it can be found in a public domain on Kaggle and it was completed via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.This data will help me with the business problem because I will be able to use the dataset for fitbit users, a high-end smart device, to understand all of it perks and what could be improved to improve Bellabeats devices and surpass Fitbit in the industry. If we look at where Fitbit is failing and winning, then we will know what needs to be improved for Bellabeat to grow successfully	</p>
									
									<h4>ROCCC Analysis </h4>
									<div class="row"> </div>
									<ul> 
										<li> <u>Reliable:</u> This data is reliable but contains bias because of the sample population that was surveyed.  </li>

										<li> <u>Original:</u> This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk </li>
										
										<li> <u>Comprehensive:</u> personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. </li>
										
										<li> <u>Current:</u> This dataset is not current because the survey was conducted between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. The data collected may not be as accurate </li>
										
										<li> <u>Cited:</u> - N/A, Unknown </li>

									</ul>

										<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
										
									</header>
									<ol> 
									<li> There are some limitations with this dataset. The survey was completed in 2016, it is now outdated. The data collected may not be as accurate because it could have changed over the years. </li>

									<li>Another limitation would be that only 30 users were surveyed. This would be an example of sample bias because there is no way to know if the population was represented. </li>

										<h3>ANALYZE </h3>
										<h4> Summary: </h4>
										
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bbcasephoto8.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bbcasephoto9.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									

										
									</header>
									<p>The summary above shows Min,Median, Max, Mean and any outliers. The average total steps recorded was 7638 and average weight was about 159 pounds with BMI of 25. </p>

									<h4> Total Distance</h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bbcasephoto10.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> The average total distance was 5 miles with the majority being light active at 3 miles, only 1.5 miles for very active and less than 1 miles for moderately active.  </p>
									
									<h4>Most Popular Days:  </h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bbcasephoto11.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/most pop day of week.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>The bar graph above displays that most active days of the thirty women was the middle of the week, Tuesday,Wednesday and Thursday. A noticeable decline in activity as it gets closer to the weekend and post weekend (Monday).  </p>

									<p> From the above chart we can note that more distance completed led to more calories being burned. </p>

										<h3>RECOMMENDATION AND ACT </h3>
										<h4> Conclusion</h4>
										
									</header>
									<p>Relations that can be concluded from this analysis include: </p>

									<ul>

										<li> The rate of calories burned is directly related to the distance and number of total steps completed </li>
										<li> The day of the week is correlated to the activity and intensity level </li>
										<li> The women that were surveyed spent most of their time in Sedentary  </li>

										

									</ul>
									<p>Bellabeat has been a successful company since 2013 but is currently small. It has the potential to grow and play a larger role in the fitness community for women. By analyzing how FitBit users utilize its features there are a few recommendations that can be concluded to push Bellabeat to its highest potential.   </p>
									<h4>Recommendations: </h4>
									<ul>
										<li>I believe it would be in Bellabeat best interest to push notifications and challenges for the weekends. This would help encourage women to be active all week rather than just during the middle of the week. </li>
										<li>Bellabeat can have push notifications and reminders to motivate women throughout the day especially if there is not a lot of activity recorded. This would help women to move to reduce sedentary  </li>
										<li>Bellabeat can allow networking opportunities and enable notifications with motivational quotes. Allowing for women to be uplifted by others, close friends, family etc.  </li>
										<li>Bellabeat can also connect with other applications and services such as Music and partner with gyms.  </li>
